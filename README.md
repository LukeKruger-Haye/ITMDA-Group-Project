## Shutterbook

Shutterbook is a mobile application developed for a small photography business, created after conducting interviews and research to understand the client’s workflow, needs, and pain points. Built with Dart and Flutter, the app provides a centralised and streamlined way to manage business operations on a single device.

Shutterbook enables the business owner to perform full CRUD operations for quotes, inventory, bookings, and clients, all backed by a single SQL database. This allows for simple, organised, efficient and independent business management without relying on multiple tools or external services.
